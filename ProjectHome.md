Simple, fast implementation of LZW data compression algorithm in C.

  * Console encoder/decoder tools
  * OS independent
  * Could be used in embedded projects
  * Works with raw code-stream

LZW features:

  * Hardcoded dictionary size
  * Variable code size
  * Code search is performed by embedded in dictionary linked lists (encoder)
  * No dynamic memory allocation

ATTENTION! the project is moving to Sourceforge.net
